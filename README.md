# Text Editor
C++ project for basic text editor

## Build instructions:
1. Run cmake to generate project files  
    Change current directory in command line to directory where project files are to be stored. Base directory can be used as build path       but is not recommended as it clutters base directory. Build files are usually saved in directory named build.   
    Run cmake <path_to_base_directory>
        If build directory is named 'build' and the current directory is base directory then command is:  
        ```
        $cd build
        $cmake ..
        ```  
    ```-G"<type>``` can be used to generate project files for different build system.   
    ```cmake .. -G``` can be used to check all available build systems.  
    To create project file for CodeBlocks using MinGW g++ compiler use:  
    ```
    cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles"
    ```
2. Use build system generated by cmake to build executable file. Executable is saved in             executable directory in project base directory.
